                <p>Welcome to Avo Fitness App (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

                <h3>Personal Data</h3>
                <p>While using our App, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). This may include, but is not limited to, your email address, name, or other details you provide when setting up your profile.</p>

                <h3>Camera and Image Data for Pose Detection</h3>
                <p>Our App uses your device's camera to provide real-time fitness coaching and exercise analysis through pose detection technology. To do this, the App requires access to your camera.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> The video stream from your camera is processed in real-time on your device to analyze your body movements and provide feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Cloud Storage of Videos:</strong> We do not record, store, or transmit your video stream to our servers or any third-party servers. The analysis is performed locally on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data from Pose Detection:</strong> We only collect the resulting pose data (e.g., coordinates of body joints) which is anonymized and used to improve our application's features and accuracy. This data is not personally identifiable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Usage Data</h3>
                <p>We may also collect information that your device sends whenever you use our App ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system version, the features of our App that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those features, and other statistics.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
                    <li>Provide you with personalized fitness feedback and tracking.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App.</li>
                    <li>Improve the functionality and accuracy of our pose detection algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>We use third-party services to help us operate our App, such as Google's ML Kit for pose detection. These services may have access to your data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google ML Kit:</strong> The pose detection feature is powered by Google's ML Kit. The processing occurs on your device. You can review Googleâ€™s privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>App Permissions</h2>
                <p>To provide our services, we request the following permissions on your device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required to access your camera for real-time exercise analysis and pose detection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> We use local storage (`shared_preferences`) to save your settings and fitness progress on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
